## Introduction

The Superstore Analysis project provides a detailed examination of the Superstore dataset to extract valuable insights and visualize the results. The dataset contains information on sales, orders, customers, and products for the retail store. By leveraging Python in Jupyter Notebook and Power BI, we uncover patterns, trends, and opportunities to improve the store's overall performance.

## Technologies Used

The analysis and visualization have been performed using the following technologies:

- Python: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and exploratory data analysis in Jupyter Notebook.
- Jupyter Notebook: Provides an interactive environment to execute Python code and document the analysis process.
- Power BI: Used for creating interactive and insightful visualizations from the processed data.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imonishkumar/superstore-analysis/main/datasets/superstore_dataset.csv). It consists of the following key attributes:

- Order ID
- Order Date
- Ship Date
- Ship Mode
- Customer ID
- Customer Name
- Segment
- Country
- City
- State
- Postal Code
- Region
- Product ID
- Category
- Sub-Category
- Product Name
- Sales
- Quantity
- Discount
- Profit

## Analysis

The analysis is divided into several sections, each targeting specific aspects of the store's performance:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and identify any data quality issues.

- **Sales Insights**: Uncovering patterns and trends in sales data, identifying peak sales periods, and analyzing sales performance across different categories and regions.

- **Customer Segmentation**: Segmenting customers based on various attributes to understand their preferences and behavior.

- **Product Performance**: Analyzing the performance of different products, identifying top-selling items, and assessing profitability.

- **Geospatial Analysis**: Visualizing sales data on a map to identify high-value regions and potential expansion opportunities.

## Visualization

The analysis results have been visualized using both Jupyter Notebook and Power BI:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Utilizes various Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create interactive visualizations directly in the notebook.

- **Power BI**: Creates interactive and dynamic dashboards and reports to provide a more user-friendly and insightful way to explore the data.

## How to Use

To reproduce the analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/imonishkumar/superstore-analysis.git`.
2. Install the required Python packages listed in the Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis and generate visualizations.
4. Open the Power BI file and interact with the Power BI dashboards and reports.
